# Digital-Image-Watermarking

# Abstract

The ease of reproduction, distribution, and manipulation of digital documents creates problems for authorized parties that wish to prevent illegal use of such document. To this end, digital watermarking has been proposed as a last line of defense. A digital watermark is an imperceptible, robust, secure message embedded directly into a document. The watermark is imperceptible both perceptually and statistically. Robustness means that the watermark cannot be removed or modified unless the
document is altered to the point of no value. The watermark is secure if unauthorized parties cannot erase or modify it. Current watermarking schemes may be viewed as spread-spectrum communications systems, which transmit a message redundantly using a low-amplitude, pseudonoise carrier signal. An example highlights the basic mechanisms and properties of spread spectrum and their relation to watermarking. Finally, specific issues in watermarking of text, images, and video.

# Expected outcomes
•	As Described Recent Development In The Digital Water Marking Of Images In Which The Water Marking Technique Is Invisible.

•	Digital Water Marking Is Rapidly Evolving Area Of Research And Development.

•	Digital Watermarking Technology Can Provide New Way To Protect The Copyright Of Multimedia Information And To Ensure The Safe Use Of Multimedia Information.

•	The study of the watermark technology has become active since mid-1990s, and some technologies are already adopted in practical applications as a product or as proprietary services for enterprises. 

•	Although this is a relatively new technology area, it quickly becomes a practical and effective solution in some application areas, and has great potential for some other areas as well. 

•	The key to the successful implementation is to understand the advantages and the limitations of the watermark technology, and to use the watermark technology as a complimentary element to the existing security elements.
